# 🌍 Community Resilience Tracker – Empowering Local Action
- Community Resilience Tracker is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help communities report, monitor, and respond to challenges in real time — across disaster events, public health, and education disruptions.

- It enables local residents and field workers to document issues, track trends, and view dashboards — even in low-resource, offline, or disaster-hit areas.

## 🛠️ Built with zero infrastructure cost, minimal maintenance, and maximum impact.
